# 🧠 GitHub Learn Notes

A personal collection of structured notes taken while studying the **[GitHub Learn](https://learn.github.com/)** courses.  
This repository is designed as a **revision and reflection tool**, helping to consolidate knowledge through active summarisation and repeated review.

It is **not** a repository of course materials or exercises — only my own notes, written in my own words.  
Any practical exercises that require code will be stored in their own repositories to respect copyright and maintain a clear learning audit trail.

## 🧭 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Organise what I’ve learned from GitHub Learn in one central place
- Reinforce memory through structured note-taking and spaced revision
- Build a public record of consistent study and technical progression
- Demonstrate disciplined self-study habits to prospective collaborators or employers
- Provide my notes to other learners who may wish to use them for comparison or revision

This is a **learning companion**, not a content mirror. Everything here is paraphrased and summarised from my understanding of the material.

## 🧩 Note-Taking Method

After each paragraph of reading or lecture content:
1. ✍️ **Summary 1** — one line summarising *just that paragraph*.  
2. 💡 **Summary 2** — one line summarising *everything learned so far*.  

This two-line structure promotes:
- Active processing of new material (forcing synthesis, not copying)  
- Fast revision later, since every concept and cumulative summary are clearly marked  
- A built-in “progressive condensation” that turns long readings into quick review sheets  

👉 For a detailed explanation of this method and why it works, check out [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiNB-6SuqVA) by Dr. Jeffrey Kaplan.
