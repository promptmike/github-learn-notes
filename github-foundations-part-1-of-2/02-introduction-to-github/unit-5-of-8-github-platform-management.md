# GitHub platform management

> 📘 Note: These notes follow a two-line progressive summary method.
> The apparent repetition is intentional — each line consolidates previous material to reinforce recall.

In this unit we will deal with notifications, subscriptions and pages
> GitHub has tools to help you track and publicise projects

## Managing notifications and subscriptions

Notifications keep you up to date, while managing subscriptions allows you to choose what to receive
> GitHub helps you stay informed on the precise information you want to receive

You can subscribe to notifications for a whole repository, a gist, activity such as pull requests or even a specific issue or workflow
> GitHub offers granular subscriptions so you will receive only the notifications you want

Interacting with a conversation auto-subscribes you, but you can also manually manage subscriptions
> GitHub automatically subscribes you to conversations, but also allows you the freedom to manually choose which notifications you want

You can unsubscribe, unwatch or customise notifications
> GitHub auto-subscribes, allows you to manually manage subscriptions and offers granular notifications for maximum relevance

## Subscribing to threads and finding threads where you're mentioned

You can configure notification channels (e.g. email, mobile) in GitHub user settings
> You can manage subscriptions and notification channels to get the most relevant updates

To watch issues of pull requests that mention a specific user, use the search qualifier *mentions:* followed by the username
> GitHub offers granular management of subscriptions for repos, events, conversations and even specific users

You can subscribe to a thread even if you were not part of the original conversation
> GitHub offers granular management of subscriptions to threads, events, specific users and entire repos

You can subscribe to a thread by selecting *Subscribe* in the right-hand sidebar
> GitHub subscriptions are both automated and manual, offering granular control

To find where you were @mentioned, use `mentions:<username>` with your own username
> GitHub subscriptions are both automated and manual, offering granular notifications and self-tracking

### Filter notifications

Select *watch* at the top of a repo page to change watch settings:
- **Watching**: You will receive notifications
- **Not Watching**: Notifications only when you participate or are @mentioned
- **Ignore**: No notifications ever
- **Custom**: Notifications only for specific activity

> GitHub subscriptions and watch settings give you granular control of notifications and channels

### Configure notification settings

Go to *Notifications* in account settings to configure:
- **Email**: Receive notifications by registered email address
- **Web**: Directly in the browser
- **Mobile**: Push notifications by mobile app
- **Custom**: Specific channels for each event type

> GitHub settings allow granular control of subscriptions and notification channels for them

## What are GitHub Pages?

You can host a website directly from a GitHub repo using GitHub Pages
> GitHub offers granular control of subscriptions and notification channels, and hosting of web pages from repos

GitHub Pages hosts static sites by taking HTML, CSS and JS directly from a repo
> GitHub offers static site hosting, granular control of subscriptions and customisation of notification channels

The next exercise will be a practical exercise (finally, I've been typing these notes for hours 😩)
> GitHub offers static site hosting from repositories, granular control of subscriptions and customisation of notification channels for specific events
