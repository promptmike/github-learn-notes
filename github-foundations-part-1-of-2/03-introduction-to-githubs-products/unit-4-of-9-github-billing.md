> The apparent repetition is intentional — each line consolidates previous material to reinforce recall.

Personal accounts and most organization accounts are billed separately, but enterprise accounts can consolidate billing for organizations they own
> GitHub offers consolidated billing for large enterprises

Bills include fixed subscriptions to plans and products, plus usage-based billing for services that incur costs over time
> GitHub offers plans, product subscriptions, and usage-based billing for additional services and consolidation of billing for enterprise
