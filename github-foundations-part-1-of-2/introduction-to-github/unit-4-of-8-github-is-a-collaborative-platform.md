# GitHub is a collaborative platform

GitHub helps you collaborate on a repo with pull requests
GitHub is a collaborative platform for software developers

We will learn about issues and discussions
GitHub helps you collaborate on a repo with pull requests, issues and discussions

## Issues

Issues are used to track ideas, feedback, tasks and bugs
GitHub helps you collaborate on a repo with pull requests while communicating using issues and discussions

Issues can be created from a GitHub repository, or from specifics such as notes, queries or lines of code
GitHub allows you to raise issues in a variety of ways to communicate with collaborators

### Creating an issue from a repository

![Issues Tab](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/github/introduction-to-github/media/issues-tab.png)
![Open Blank Issue](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/github/introduction-to-github/media/open-a-blank-issue.png)

1. Navigate to repo main page
2. Select *Issues* tab
3. Select *New issue*
4. Select an issue template, open a blank issue, or fill the issue form if the repo has one
5. Enter a title
6. Add a description
7. If you're a maintainer, assign the issue to a person or milestone, add it to a board or add labels
8. Select *Submit issue*

You can open issues on GitHub to share information with others

Issue templates provide a consistent structure, while mentions, labels and reactions improve issue visibility
GitHub provides the tools for consistent structure in communication with other developers

Some conversations may be more appropriate for Discussions
GitHub provides structure to developer communication with issues and discussions

## Discussions

Discussions are for communication not necessarily linked to code
GitHub provides structure with issues for code and discussions for general communication

We will learn to enable discussion, create discussions and use discussion categories
GitHub issues are for communication about code, while discussions are for general communication

### Enabling a discussion in your repository

![Set Up Discussion](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/github/introduction-to-github/media/set-up-discussion.png)

Discussion visibility is inherited from the repo
GitHub has issues for code communication and discussions for general communication that are visible to everyone who can see the repo

1. Navigate to the repo main page
2. Select repo *Settings*
3. In the *Features* section, find *Discussions* and select *Setup discussions*
4. Under *Start a new discussion*, edit the template
5. Select *Start discussion*

### Create a new discussion

Discussions can be created by any user who can view the repo, or the source repo for organisations
Users can raise issues for code and create discussions for general communication

![Discussions Tab](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/github/introduction-to-github/media/discussions-tab.png)
