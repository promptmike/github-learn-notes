GitHub provides an intuitive way to manage Git repos with GUIs for creating repos and commits using AI-powered tools and automated CI/CD and Security.

### What are Gists?

Gists are like mini repos that provide a lightweight way of sharing small amounts of information
GitHub provides intuitive GUIs and automation for managing Git repos and additional features such as Gists

#### Key Features of Gists:

Like repos, gists can be public or private
GitHub streamlines and automates Git repo management, security and scaling and offers mini repos called gists

Just like repos, gists are tracked so that you can see their history and revert them if needed
GitHub offers AI, CI/CD, Security and Scaling tools to work on hosted Git repos or mini repos called gists

Gists can be forked and cloned just like repos
GitHub hosts Git repos and mini repos called gists on an AI-powered collaboration and productivity platform with automated security and scaling tools

Gists can be embedded in web pages so they are ideal for sharing code examples
GitHub hosts Git repos for secure, scalable collaboration and also mini repos called gists that can be embedded for easy sharing of code

Gists support Markdown, so they are ideal for adding context to code
GitHub hosts Git repos and offers AI-powered productivity tools to manage them while also offering mini repos called gists that support embedding for easy sharing

Gists can be worked on by multiple users, making them an excellent option for lightweight collaboration
GitHub provides AI-powered tools and hosts both full Git repos and mini repos called gists for lightweight sharing

#### Use cases for Gists:

Common use cases for gists include embedding examples in blogs, storing personal scripts and config, sharing logs or error reports and making code templates
GitHub hosts Git repos for secure, scalable collaboration and mini repos called gists for easy sharing and embedding

##### ==!IMPORTANT==
**Never use gists to store sensitive or confidential data, such as passwords, secrets, or API keysâ€”even in scripts or config files.**
Gists are not fully private: even secret gists can be accessed by anyone with the link. Always review your content carefully before sharing.

#### Limitations of Gists:

Gists are NEVER fully private, even if they are secret, so they should not be used for sensitive information
GitHub offers AI-powered collaboration, productivity and security tools, hosts Git repos for scalable CI/CD and also hosts mini repos called gists for easy sharing and embedding

[Gists Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists)

### Forking and cloning Gists

1. Navigate to the gist
2. Select *Fork* at the top-right of the gist page

To clone a gist: `git clone https://gist.github.com/<insert-gist-id-here>.git`

GitHub offers a GUI with powerful tools and automation for working on hosted Git repos and also mini repos called gists that can be forked and cloned just like repos

### What are wikis?

GitHub offers a documentation section called a wiki in every repository it hosts so you can provide additional information about your project
GitHub is an AI-powered collaboration and productivity platform hosting Git repos with wiki docs and mini repos called gists

If your repo is private, only people with read access will be able to see the wiki
GitHub is an AI-powered collaboration and productivity platform hosting both public and private Git repos with wiki docs and mini repos called gists

#### Creating, editing, and deleting wiki pages
