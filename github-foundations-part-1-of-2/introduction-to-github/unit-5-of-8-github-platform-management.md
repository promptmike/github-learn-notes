In this unit we will deal with notifications, subscriptions and pages
GitHub has tools to help you track and publicise projects

## Managing notifications and subscriptions

Notifications keep you up to date, while managing subscriptions allows you to choose what to receive
GitHub helps you stay informed on the precise information you want to receive

You can subscribe to notifications for a whole repository, a gist, activity such as pull requests or even a specific issue or workflow
GitHub offers granular subscriptions so you will receive only the notifications you want

Interacting with a conversation auto-subscribes you, but you can also manually manage subscriptions
GitHub automatically subscribes you to conversations, but also allows you the freedom to manually choose which notifications you want

You can unsubscribe, unwatch or customise notifications
GitHub auto-subscribes, allows you to manually manage subscriptions and offers granular notifications for maximum relevance

## Subscribing to threads and finding threads where you're mentioned

You can configure notification channels (e.g. email, mobile) in GitHub user settings
You can manage subscriptions and notification channels to get the most relevant updates

To watch issues of pull requests that mention a specific user, use the search qualifier *mentions:* followed by the username
GitHub offers granular management of subscriptions for repos, events, conversations and even specific users

You can subscribe to a thread even if you were not part of the original conversation
GitHub offers granular management of subscriptions to threads, events, specific users and entire repos

You can subscribe to a thread by selecting *Subscribe* in the right-hand sidebar
GitHub subscriptions are both automated and manual, offering granular control

To find where you were @mentioned, use `mentions:<username>` with your own username
GitHub subscriptions are both automated and manual, offering granular notifications and self-tracking

### Filter notifications

Select *watch* at the top of a repo page to change watch settings:
- **Watching**: You will receive notifications
- **Not Watching**: Notifications only when you participate or are @mentioned
- **Ignore**: No notifications ever
- **Custom**: Notifications only for specific activity

GitHub subscriptions and watch settings give you granular control of notifications and channels

### Configure notification settings

Go to *Notifications* in account settings to configure:
- **Email**: Receive notifications by registered email address
- **Web**: Directly in the browser
- **Mobile**: Push notifications by mobile app
- **Custom**: Specific channels for each event type

GitHub settings allow granular control of subscriptions and notification channels for them

## What are GitHub Pages?

You can host a website directly from a GitHub repo using GitHub Pages
GitHub offers granular control of subscriptions and notification channels, and hosting of web pages from repos

GitHub Pages hosts static sites by taking HTML, CSS and JS directly from a repo
GitHub offers static site hosting, granular control of subscriptions and customisation of notification channels

The next exercise will be a practical exercise (finally, I've been typing these notes for hours ðŸ˜©)
GitHub offers static site hosting from repositories, granular control of subscriptions and customisation of notification channels for specific events
