# Introduction

GitHub Codespaces is an instant environment that uses a container to provide you with development tools
GitHub Codespaces allows you to open VS Code in a container and work directly in your browser

We will study the Codespaces lifecycle and processes, how customise a Codespace set up, and the difference between GitHub Codespaces and github.dev
GitHub Codespaces is a customisable container-based environment you can customise, and it is **NOT** the same as github.dev
