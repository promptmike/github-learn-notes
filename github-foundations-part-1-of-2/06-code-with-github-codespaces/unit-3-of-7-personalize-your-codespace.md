# Personalize your Codespace

With dotfiles and Settings Sync, you can define a dev container to customise your Codespaces
Codespaces are customisable from the repository

## What you can customize

- **Settings Sync** to synchronise VS Code settings between desktop and web client
- **Dotfiles** to specify scripts, shell preferences and other configurations
- **Rename** to change the display name
- **Change your shell** in a new terminal or by configuring the dotfiles
- **Change the machine type** to change the type of VM
- **Set the default editor** to VS Code (desktop or web client), JetBrains Gateway or JupyterLab
- **Set the default region** to decide where your data is held
- **Set the timeout** for how long inactive Codespaces continue running
- **Configure automatic deletion** to choose how long stopped Codespaces are retained

Codespaces can be customized from GitHub settings or from dotfiles to sync with VS Code, change the shell, region and VM, and decide the default editor, machine type and timeouts
