# How to organize and automate your project

> 📘 Note: These notes follow a two-line progressive summary method.  
> The apparent repetition is intentional — each line consolidates previous material to reinforce recall.

We will now learn how to provide visibility and access to projects, and how to delete projects
> Projects can be created, have visibility and access changed, and be deleted

## Project visibility and access

- Control visibility
- Manage access
- Invite collaborators and change roles
- Add project to team
- Add projects to repo

> GitHub Projects allows you to create and delete projects, control visibility and access, assign roles to collaborators, and assign projects to teams or repos

### Control visibility to your Project

You can make projects public or private
> Projects offers projects creation and deletion, visibility and access control, roles for collaborators, and assigning projects to teams or repos

### Manage access to your Project

Personal and organization projects have different access
> Projects can be public or private, organization or personal, and assigned to teams or repos, with access control and roles for collaborators

Admins of organization-owned projects can manage access at organization, team and individual levels, while admins of user-owned projects can invite individuals and manage their access
> Organization projects are managed with multi-layer access control, while user projects must grant individual access - either can be public or private

#### Organization-owned Project

**==Options==**
- **No Access:**    Visible to only owners and users granted individual access
- **Read:**         Visible to the whole organisation
- **Write:**        Visible and editable by whole organisation
- **Admin**         Everyone in the organisation is an admin

> Organization projects can set access control policy, while user projects must grant individual access - either can be public or private

#### Personal/User-owned Project

**==Options==**
- **Read:** The individual can view
- **Write:** The individual can view and edit
- **Admin:** The individual can view, edit and add new collaborators

> Organization projects can set access control policy for the entire organisation, while user projects can only add access for individuals - either can be public or private

### Invite collaborators and change roles

![Manage Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/github/manage-work-github-projects/media/5-manage-access-settings.png)

1. Navigate to project
2. Top-right > `...` > *Settings*
3. Left-navigation > *Manage Access*
4. *Invite collaborators* or change roles with *Manage access*

> Organization projects can set group and individual access, user projects can set individual access, both can invite collaborators and change their roles

### Add a Project to a team

Organisations can add a project to a team, granting every member of that team read access
> Organization projects have group and individual access control, user projects have individual access control, both can invite collaborators and set roles

1. Top-right > Profile photo > *Your organizatinos*
2. Select organisation
3. *Teams* tab > Select team
4. Select *Projects* > *Link a project*
5. Start typing the project name, then select it

> Organization accounts can assign projects to teams, grant group and individual access, invite collaborators and change roles

### Add a Project to a repository

A project can only be added to a repository if they have the same owner
> Organization accounts can assign projects to their teams and repos, grant group and individual access, invite collaborators and change roles

![Add Project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/github/manage-work-github-projects/media/5-add-project.png)

1. Navigate to repo main page
2. *Projects* tab > Select *Link a project*
3. Search for projects with the same owner as the repo
4. Select project

> Organizations can add projects to their teams and repos they own, grant group and individual access, invite collaborators and assign them roles

## Close and delete Projects

When you no longer need a project you can close or delete it
> User accounts can set individual access and add projects to repos, while Organization accounts can also grant group access and assign projects to teams

Closing a project removes it from the project list, but retains all data
> User accounts can grant access and roles to individuals, while Organization accounts can also grant group access and assign to teams

Deleting a project permanently removes it from GitHub
> User accounts can grant access and roles to individuals and add projects to owned repos, while Organization accounts can also grant group access and assign projects to teams

1. Navigate to project
2. Top-right > `...` > *Settings*
3. Scroll to *Danger zone* section, then choose delete or close and type the project name

## Converting checklist items to sub-issues

1. Open an issue that includes a checklist
2. Hover over checklist item > `...`
3. Select *Convert to sub-issue*

> Projects can be created, closed, reopened and deleted, given access control and added to owned repos, while Organization accounts can also use group access control and assign to teams

The sub-issues become dedicated issued linked back to the original one, for better task tracking and hierarchy in Projects view
> Projects can be assigned to repos, have individual access control, and contain sub-issues for tracking, while Organization projects can also use group access control and assign to team
