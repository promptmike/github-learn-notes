# Summary

> 📘 Note: These notes follow a two-line progressive summary method.  
> The apparent repetition is intentional — each line consolidates previous material to reinforce recall.

Code scanning works with GitHub's CodeQL, or with third-party tools, allowing you to schedule and trigger scans to keep your code base safe
> Code scanning is very useful, because it keeps alerts in a central location you can easily follow, while also reducing the need for manual checks that are slower and more error prone
