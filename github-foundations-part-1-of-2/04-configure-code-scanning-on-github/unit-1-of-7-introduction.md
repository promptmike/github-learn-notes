# Introduction

> 📘 Note: These notes follow a two-line progressive summary method.  
> The apparent repetition is intentional — each line consolidates previous material to reinforce recall.

GitHub Advanced Security license includes code scanning, which identifies vulnerable code
> GHAS code scanning can be run manually or triggered by events to identify vulnerable code

Code scanning can be implemented using CodeQL, third party tools or Actions
> Code scanning should be configured for your project and implemented with CodeQL, third party tools or Actions

# Learning Objectives

We will learn how to enable code scanning, trigger code scanning and implement codescanning in a workflow
> Code scanning should be configured to meet project needs
