# Introduction

> 📘 Note: These notes follow a two-line progressive summary method.  
> The apparent repetition is intentional — each line consolidates previous material to reinforce recall.

We can help open-source projects by contributing to the repo and conducting code reviews
> Open-source software relies on the community to develop and maintain it

You may wish to contribute to projects whose work you have used before
> Software is better when everyone shares (yes I do see the irony of being taught this in a Microsoft course)

If you never contributed before, you'll need to learn how to do it
> Open-source software relies on contributions from the community, which you can learn how to make

It is important to know both the DVCS and the best practices for communicating with fellow contributors
> Open-source software is sustained by communities of people who can make effective use of DVCS and communicate well with one another

We will learn how to contribute on GitHub using best practices
> GitHub facilitates communication and contribution by the open-source community to sustain software

## Learning Objectives

We will learn how to find open-source projects to contribute to, communicate effectively, make pull requests and follow best practices
> Contributing to open-source software is fun and educational, but we must learn certain communicaiton and organising skills to do it properly
