# Exercise - Create your first pull request

We will learn how to make a PR with or without guidance
> Some projects offer contributing guidance and some don't

## Describe your changes

**Subject Line**
- Describe changes
 - If applied, this commit will `<subject line>`
- Imperative, present tense
 - *Add*, not *Adds* or *Added*
- Under 50 characters
- Start with capital letter
- No period `.`
- Check if project allows emojis or @mentions before using them

> Follow best practices for PRs and follow repo contributing guidelines

**Body**
- Present tense
    - *Builds*, not *Built* or *will Build*
- Contrast with previous behaviour
- Include motivation for change
    - **What** and **Why**, not just **How**

> Use imperative present tense, contrast with previous code and explain motivation for change

Commit small, isolated sets of changes
> Imperative present tense, contrast with existing, explain **What** and **Why**, small modular commits

## Add granularity

Check the sidebar for PR completion methods (e.g. Reviewers, Assignees, labels)
> Imperative present tense, contrast with existing, motivation, commit small and often, use the sidebar

**💡 ==Tip==**
If the repository has a CONTRIBUTING.md file or a PR template, follow its guidance when filling in your pull request.

**Label examples**
- Bug (red): something not working
- Documentation (blue): add to docs
- Duplicate (grey): this item already exists
- Enhancement (teal): new feature

> Imperative present tense, contrast existing, motivation, commit often, check sidebar, use labels

If your PR might close an existing issue, you can link the issue in the sidebar
> Imperative present tense, contrast existing, show motives, commit often, use labels, add people, link issues

**Notification options**
- Not subscribed: Receive nothing unless you contribute or are @mentioned
- Subscribed: Receive all notifications
- Custom: Notifications for selected events

> Imperative present tense, contrast existing, be concise, show motives, commit often, use labels, add people, link issues, set notifications
