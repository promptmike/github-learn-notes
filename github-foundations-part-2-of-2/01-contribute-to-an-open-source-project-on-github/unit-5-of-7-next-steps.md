# Next steps

> 📘 Note: These notes follow a two-line progressive summary method.  
> The apparent repetition is intentional — each line consolidates previous material to reinforce recall.

We should immerse ourselves in project communities
> Contributing to Open Source is better when you engage with the community

## Get involved in the community

Use *Insights* or the comments sections to find other active community members
> Find other contributors and engage with the project community

You can follow organisations and enterprises too
> Find contributors, organisations and enterprises that interest you and follow to stay up to date with the community

You can even attend meetups for open-source topics that interest you
> Follow contributors and organisation, and attend meetups if possible, to engage with the community

Some projects have a central communication channel
> Follow project contributors and use communication channels provided by the project

# Code reusability

**Sharing Solutions**
- Publish a library
- Mirror the project
- Create a GitHub Action for workflows

> If you solve an issue in one project, others may also benefit from your solution

If you choose to mirror the project, you will need to keep your fork up to date with the upstream repo
> Solve issues, share solutions and stay up to date with the community

You can upload your solution workflows to GitHub Marketplace to be discovered by others
> Solve issues, share solutions, upload workflows to Marketplace and engage with the community

Remember, when you publish a solution you are now the maintainer of it
> Solve issues, share solutions you are prepared to maintain, and engage with the developer community

Plan project maintenance and set expectations in your README file
> Develop solutions, share what you are prepared to maintain, find co-maintainers if necessary, and engage with the developer community
