Use [GitHub Search](https://github.com/search) to find projects to contribute to

Read the docs first - especially README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING AND CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT and check labels for help needed

Check for additional communication channels (e.g. and IRC)

**PR best practices**
- Be consise
 - Subject line under 50 characters
 - Commit small, isolated sets of changes
- Use the imperative, present tense
    - *Add*, not *Adds* or *Added*
- Show motivation
    - Contrast changes with existing code
    - Explain what merging your PR will do
    - **What** and **Why**, not merely **How**
- Use the sidebar
    - Add Reviewers or Assignees
    - Use labels
    - Link issues that may be closed by your PR
- Remember to set notifications for the updates you want
