# Identify where you can help

We will learn how to use issues and tags to contribute to open-source projects
Finding open-source projects to contribute to is important for skill development

Open-source software can be viewed, shared and used by anyone
Sharing code makes software more secure and reliable (oh the irony that this is a Microsoft course)

Contributing can be scary at first, but there is something for everyone
Open-source projects need a variety of contributions from the beginner level to the expert level

## Find an open-source project that needs contributions

It is easier to contribute when you are already familiar with a project and its community
If you like a project and its community, you can contribute no matter your skill level

Finding *anything* broken, even a simple typo, is an opportunity to contribute a fix
If you like a project and its community, you can see problems as opportunities to contribute

### Tip

The most important thing is the will to help
You can and *should* contribute to projects you like and admire, regardless of skill level, as this will help you learn

## Use GitHub search

Use [GitHub search](https://github.com/search) to enter topics that interest you
You should look for projects you like in areas that interest you and contribute, because this will build skills

Enter key words, then narrow your search with the sidebar
Actively search for projects that interest you with communities you can admire, then contribute and build your skills

## Familiarize yourself with an open-source project

Every open-source project has its own guidelines that you should follow
Search for projects that interest you, become familiar with their communities and follow their contribution guidelines

Read the docs - LICENSE, README, CONTRIBUTING and CODE_OF_CONDUCT to learn how to contribute properly
Actively search for projects in topics that interest you and follow their rules for open-source contribution

Not all projects have CONTRIBUTING or CODE_OF_CONDUCT docs - having them indicates they are friendly to contributors
Find projects of interest that welcome contributors of your skill level and follow the rules in their docs

Open-source projects often have additional communication channels for contributors
Find projects that welcome contributors of your skill level, communicate with the community and follow the rules in their docs

- Issue trackers: add **/issues** to the end of the repo URL
- Pull request: add **/pull** to the end of the repo URL
- Chats and forums: e.g Slack or IRC

## Identify tasks to work on

Find a project, read the guidelines and contribute
Actively search for projects in areas that interest you with communities you support and follow their guidelines to contribute whatever you can.

If you have already found a project, visit its CONTRIBUTE url by adding **/contribute** to the end of the project url
Actively search for projcets to contribute to, visit /issues, /pull and /contribute, then offer what you can at your skill level

Issues in the /contribute URL will usually have labels telling you what kind of help is needed
Actively search for projects to contribute to, visit /issues, /pull and /contribute, check labels for information on the help needed, then contribute at your skill level

You can use the labels URL by adding **/labels** to the end of the project url to identify issues you can help with
Find a project, visit /issues, /pull, /contribute and /labels, then provide whatever help you can at your skill level

Some issues have other pull requests linked
Actively search for a project in a topic that interests you with a community you respect, then visit /issues, /pull, /contribute and /labels, then contribute what you can

## Sponsor a project

You can financially support an open-source project with sponsorship
Actively search for projects in topics that interest you with communities you respect and support them with contributions or sponsorship

GitHub Sponsors allows you to financially contribute to projects
Take advantage of GitHub features to find projects you want to contribute to in any way you can while building skills

If a project is eligible for sponsorship you will find a Sponsor button on the main page
